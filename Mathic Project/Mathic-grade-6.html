       <p>
        With each plane figure, two things are positively associated:
    <ul>
       <li> (i) Region</li>
       <li> (ii) Boundary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For comparison of two plane figures, some measures are needed.
        Perimeter</p>
        <p>
        The perimeter of a closed figure is the distance covered along the line forming the closed figure when we make a complete round of the figure once.
        The concept of the parameter is widely used in our daily life. For example, in fencing a field, in preparing a track to conduct sports, in building a compound wall on all sides of a house, etc.</p>
       <br>
       <p>
        Perimeter of a rectangle = Sum of the lengths of its four sides = 2 × (Length + Breadth)
        <br>
        Perimeter of regular shapes
        <br>

        Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = 3 × length of a side
        <br>
        The perimeter of a square = 4 × length of a side
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
        There is an interesting similarity between a square and an equilateral triangle. They are figures having the sides of equal length and all the angles of equal measure. Such figures are known as regular closed figures. Thus, a square and an equilateral triangle are regular closed figures.
        Area</p>>
        <p>
        The amount of surface enclosed by a closed figure is called its area.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The comparison of two figures as to which one has a larger area is difficult to make just by looking at these figures. To solve the purpose, we put the figure on a squared paper or graph paper whose every square measure 1 cm × 1 cm. Make an outline of the figure. Look at the squares enclosed by the figure. Some of them are completely enclosed, some half, some less than half and some more than half. To overcome this difficulty, the following convention is adopted: </p>
        <p>
        The area of one full square is taken as 1 square unit. If it is a centimeter square sheet, the area of one full square will be 1 sq cm. </p>
        
        
        <p>Ignore portions of the area that are less than half a square.
        If more than half of a square is in a region, just count it as one square.
        If exactly half the square is counted,
        <br>
         take its area as 12 sq unit.
        Finally, the area of the figure is the number of centimeter squares that are needed to cover it.<br>

        Area of a rectangle = Length × Breadth
        <br>
        Area of a square = Side × Side.

        Maths Formulas for Class 6 Decimals  <br>
        <br>
        Dot represents a decimal point.
        <br>
        Thus, five rupees seventy-five paise = rs 5.75
        <br>
        Seven rupees fifty paise = rs 7.50.

        <br>

        To understand the parts of one whole (i.e., a unit) we show a unit by a block. Thus two units are two blocks and so on. One block divided into 10 equal parts means each part is 110 (one- tenth) of a unit, two parts are 2-tenths, five parts are 5-tenths and so on. 110 in decimal notation is written as 0.1. The dot represents the decimal point and it comes between the units place and tenths place.
        Every fraction with denominator 10 can be written in decimal notation and vice-versa.
        For example:
        <br>

        
        
        Hundredths
        One block divided into 100 equal parts means each part is 1/100 (one-hundredth) of a unit. It can be written as 0.01 in decimal notation.
        Every fraction with denominator 100 can be written in decimal notation and vice-versa.
        In place value table, as we go from left to right, then at every step the multiplying factor becomes 1/10 of the previous factor. The place value table can be further extended from hundredths to 1/10 of hundredths, i.e., thousandths (1/100), which is written as 0.001 in decimal notation.
        All the decimals can be represented on a number line.
        Every decimal can be written as a fraction.
        We can compare any two decimals. The process of comparison starts with the whole part. If the whole parts are equal then the tenths parts are compared. If the tenths parts are also equal then hundredths parts arc compared and so on.
        <br>
        
        Decimals are used in numerous ways in our lives. For example in representing units of money, length and weight.
        <br>
        Money
        <br>
        1 paisa = ₹ 1/100 = ₹ 0.01
        <br>
        85 paise = ₹ 85/100— = ₹ 0.85
        <br>
        125 paise = ₹ 1 and 25 paise = ₹ 1.25
        <br>
        Length
        <br>
        1 cm = 1/100 m = 0.01 m
        <br>
        46 cm = 46/100 m = 0.46 m
        <br>
        126 cm = 100 cm + 26 cm = 1 m + 26/100 m = 1.26 m
        <br>
        Weight
        <br>
        1 g = 1/1000 kg = 0.001 kg
        <br>
        2650 g = 2000 g + 650 g
        <br>
        = 2000/1000 kg + 650/1000 kg
        <br>
        = 2 kg + 0.650 kg
        <br>
        = 2.650 kg
